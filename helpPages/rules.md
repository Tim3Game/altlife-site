# Rules and Regulations
Every roleplay server has some general rules and guidelines. alt:Life is no different. Below you will find a general summary of all the rules that apply on the server. Rules are loosely defined but should give enough context for most players to abide by. They should be used as a code of conduct and any player that does not follow these rules will receive several warnings before being permanently banned.

---

## Code is Law
This means that the script dictates whether or not you are able to do something. If the script allows it; then so be it. If you're dead, you're dead. If you're alive, you're alive. If you have a gun in-hand, you have a gun in-hand. There are no exceptions to this. You do not have any non-scripted items unless both parties agree.

## Racial Slurs and Toxic Behavior
If you are spamming racial slurs and being generally toxic you will be permanently banned. The year is 2020 and just because it's Roleplay doesn't give you the right to be a bigot.

## Distasteful Roleplay
If you are attempting to roleplay as a terrorist faction, alt-right faction, or anything of the sort it will not be tolerated. You will be banned.

## Third-Party Tools
Any tools that are used that give you a distinct advantage over any other player are not allowed. Keybinds are okay.

Hacking, Speed Hacking, Wall Hacking, etc.
We have a built in anti-cheat that will catch you and kick you INSTANTLY.

* Aimbot
* No Clip (2s-5s)
* Teleporting (2s-5s)
* Speed Hacking (2s-5s)
* Health Hacks (Both Kinds) (5-10s)
* Armour Hacks (Both Kinds) (5-10s)
* Flying (2s)
* Rapid Fire (2s)
* Weapon Hacks

## Disputes in Roleplay
Rather than having administrators constantly interrupt Roleplay we have a very simple rule. If you come across a dispute with another player and cannot agree on an outcome you can either /flipcoin or /d20 to determine the outcome of the scenario. Players that do not abide by the outcome should be considered Power Gamers.

* A player is standing on the other side of the door.
* ie. /me attempts to push open the door.
* ie. /do Do you let me push open the door?
* ie. Other Player: /do No, you're not strong enough.
* ie. ... At this point, it would be a dispute because nobody knows how strong you are.
* ie. Me: /b Let's flip a coin to decide the outcome.
* ie. Other Player: /b ok
* ie. /do Heads - I push the door open. Tails - You hold me back.
* ie. /flipcoin
* ie. It's Tails

Failure to respect the outcome of a coin flip or d20 will be considered Power Gaming.

## Odds Against You
The act of being outnumbered in a hostile situation means that you are unable to 'John Wick' your way out of things. Meaning that if there are 2 people forcing you into a roleplay scenario and you're alone. You are now required to go along with their requests. 

Going against these requests will be considered Power Gaming. This rule does not apply when they are forcing non-consensual sexual roleplay or grotesque behavior on you in a forceful manner. 

You may leave a scenario that you do not fully agree with at any time.
Roleplay is a consensual agreement.

## ERP (Sexual Roleplay)
Any form of sexual or explicit Roleplay must have a consensual agreement between both parties. 

No exceptions.

## Power Gaming
The act of doing something super-human that goes against any human abilities. It is important to know that Power Gaming is also defined as an act that actively defies the outcome of a situation when the other party has the advantage.

* ie. When you have a gun pointed at you and you push that gun aside to point a gun at them.

Basically don't try to John Wick your way out of a situation.

## Meta Gaming
MetaGaming is when a player uses out of game knowledge to their advantage; this does not include personal experiences. Moreso just public knowledge of player whereabouts, who another player knows, etc.

* ie. Stalking a player on Twitch and following them to their location.
* ie. Finding out information on Discord to use in-game against another player.

## Reporting with Insufficient Evidence
Reporting another player will require you to explicitly have video or photographic evidence with a clear understanding of the situation that is currently at play. 

If you are submitting false reports with an event that is impossible to follow. You will be given a temporary ban. 

Keep in mind that if you feel you've been wronged in the middle of Roleplay and you start recording, this does not count as sufficient evidence.

There is plenty of software out there that explicitly allows you to recover over the previous ‘x’ minutes of time. Use them to your advantage if you’re afraid of being wronged.

## Guns are Illegal
All guns are illegal in this server. 
Having a gun means you can be taken in by any Police faction.
Weapon parts are fully legal.
Gun licenses allow you to physically own that weapon and be legal.

## Failure to Report a Bug
Found a bug but it drastically changed the economy because of that bug? 

You'll be banned permanently for failing to report this bug to an Administrator or Moderator.

## Mass Death Matching
If you're just shooting people without a purpose that is a warnable offense.

Safe Zones provide safe spaces for most people. 

However, in a turf/point that is not an active war zone you should avoid shooting.

Just because you can shoot. Doesn't mean you should.

## Player Shoots First Rule
All police related factions may not use any form of deadly weapons unless they are provoked through a gun fight.

If that gang member shoots first then it’s open season on that individual member.
