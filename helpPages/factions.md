# Factions

Factions are just a fancy way of saying police, gang, or business. All factions utilize a similar system that is flexible. The faction panel can be accessed by pressing `F4`.

---

## Rules for Factions
Factions are entirely player created and have no limit to the amount of factions that can exist for the gang and business subtypes.

However, there is a limited number of slots for police, fbi, noose, fdsa, and news factions. Meaning that only one of each type may exist at any point in time.

This is important for ensuring that these factions are not fighting over their responsibilities. Gangs and Businesses however are meant to be chaotic. Only leadership can maintain order in those factions.


## Skills (Not All Unlockable By Every Subtype)

Certain subtypes get immediate access to some of these skills. However, a lot of skills must be unlocked by contributing Reward Points to a faction.

Note: Reward Points are spent, not reclaimed. Ever.
