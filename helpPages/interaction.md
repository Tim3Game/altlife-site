# Interaction

Interaction defines how you interact with the world. Interaction can be done in a very specific way.

---

1. Hold down your `TAB` key.
2. Hover over a player, object, vehicle, npc, etc. with your mouse.
3. Press your `Right Mouse Button (Right Click)`.
4. Select an option with your `Left Mouse Button (Left Click)`
5. `TAB` can now be released.

Tip: If a line is drawn between you and the world object that means it is recognized as an interactable world object.
