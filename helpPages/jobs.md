You will recieve unrefined metal each time you mine as well as mining experience.

## Mining Refinery

## Make Your Own
The jobs you see above are simply scripted in jobs for players that don't want to make the effort to sell anything to other players. Businesses provide the opportunity for any player to make their very own job. However, these make your own jobs require other players for you to turn a profit.

Here's a few ideas to get you started:

* Craft food and deliver it to players.
* Craft tools and sell them to players.
* Refine drugs and sell them to players.
* Gather resources, refine them, and sell them to gangs, players, etc.

There's a lot you can do with just the resources you come in contact with.
