# General Information

This section covers the small information you may not know about this game mode and what general restrictions are implemented. Think of them as passive rules.

---

## Health & Hunger
Health in this server can be regained by simply eating food. Food can be crafted at any `cooking source`.

Hunger only occurs when your health is above 60. Health will slowly tick down from any value above 60 until it reaches 60. Having health above 60 is a temporary buff for eating food and potentially being in combat.

Health below 30 in value will slowly tick up to 30 over a longer period of time.

You will never die from not feeding yourself.

## Drugs (Kevlarium & Vigorium)
There are two types of drugs on this server that have their very own distinct benefit.

Kevlarium will give players a small amount of armour for each bit of Refined Kevlarium they take. This will also degrade their health.

Vigorium will give players a temporary buff to their agility level which will allow them to run for longer periods of time. This will last for exactly 1 minute. Vigorium will also degrade health.

## Combat
Combat is restricted to the users who own a gun license. 
All users are restricted from punching, shooting, etc. until they own a gun license.

## Gun Licenses
Gun licenses can be crafted from any crafting point.
Gun licenses can be purchased from any un-owned Ammunation.
Licenses are lost when a player dies.

## Weapons & Weaponry
Weaponry can be crafted by gang members who own points/turfs. Pistols can be purchased from an Ammunation if the point/turf is unowned. All profits towards an unowned Ammunations go towards all active online Police Factions.

## Death
Players who wait for their timer to expire on death will not lose any money.

Players who use `/revive` will lose 5% of their total income with a minimum restriction of `$100`. There is no maximum.

Players who are shot by another player and die can be investigated by the FBI. All dead players leave behind a Dead Body for 10 Minutes. If the body is investigated there will be a warrant out for your arrest.

All weaponry is removed from a player on death.

All gun licenses are removed from a player on death.

## Arresting
Police factions may arrest by using tazers or asking the player to perform the `/handsup` command. Once this handsup command is performed and the Officer has cuffs in their inventory they may interact with the player to arrest them.

If a Police Officer disconnects or dies the player whom was cuffed by this officer may break cuffs in 10 minutes. They can do so by interacting with themselves.

Players who are tazed in a vehicle may have their window broken through the script and forced out of their vehicle.

Loggin out while being arrested will immediately put you in Jail.

## Jail
All arrests cannot exceed more than 10 Minutes of jail time. Jail time is handled automatically and will immediately release a player after jail time is completed.
